Hi, my name is **Muhammad** and I am a Nigerian, I have a background in computer science and I've worked in data science for 4 years now.

I started my journey as a **security enthisiast** where i help find _vulnarabilities_ in systems,
Then worked my way up to a **full stack software engineer** where i have helped build solutions ranging from Web, Mobile & IOT,
It was very challenging because prior to this role I have only found ways to break systems not build them.

Finally, transitioning into a **machine learning engineer** where I now specialize in building, testing, deploying and maintaining ML systems in production,
ensuring reliability and confidence across different slices of data (Measuring `performance decay`, `Fairness` & `Data drift` etc.)

This has been a fun experience for me, which has allowed me look at things differently
& also build machine learning systems with security & software engineering best practices in mind
