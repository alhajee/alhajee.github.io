### Building the future with a smile üòÅ

Hi there üëã, I‚Äôm **Muhammad**, A FullStack Software Engineer from Nigeria, I obtained a major in computer science and ever since I've worked in industries like E-Commerce, Fintech and Data science.

I started my journey as a **security enthusiast** where I helped find vulnerabilities in systems. Then I worked my way up to a **full stack software engineer** where I built solutions ranging from Web, Mobile & IOT. This was a challenging transition for me because prior to this role I have only found ways to break systems, not build them. Some of my key contributions include discovering & patching architectural and design flaws in a number of Government agencies, building a platform that uses real-time data in for dispatching and managing logistics.

Finally, transitioning into a **machine learning engineer** where I specialized in building, testing, deploying and maintaining ML systems in production, I am able to ensure reliability and confidence across different slices of data (`Measuring performance decay, Fairness & Data drift etc.`) My most recent work includes leading a team of Engineers to build a `Demand forecasting` model that analyzes `Time-series` data and predicts product `inventory & sales`.

Overall, it has been a fun experience for me, and my diverse experience has allowed me to look at things differently & also build systems with security & software engineering best practices in mind.
